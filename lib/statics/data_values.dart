Many techniques for reducing network security threats may be quickly and easily implemented using the P4-programmable data plane without slowing down or interfering with regular traffic Using the stateful processing capabilities of programmable switches, in the course of this research, we develop a system that is able to monitor DNS traffic in the data plane and then apply the security rules that have been established by the administrator to certain domains.';

This article presents a system named ETMRTCM, which effectively centralized traffic coordination as a solution for overcoming transitory bottlenecks on multi-lane motorways. At initially, warning alerts regarding the traffic congestion happened depending on Vehicle to Vehicle communications. Then, automobiles start negotiating with their neighbors to figure out the best structure (platoon leader, distance gap, speed, and the number of vehicles) for formulating platoons.As a result, cars can move through the congestion more efficiently. After that, the platoon leaders give orders to the troops to switch lanes if there is an open space in the road adjacent to the one in which they are. ';
